I built a new website for a law firm in Japan.

### Live demo
[BridgeRoots Law firm website](https://cassielawfirm.netlify.com/)

### Background
I collaborated with my friend [@irzzz](http://github.com/irzzz) (UX Designer) in this project. Irene gave me a high-fidelity wireframe for the landing page in desktop view. I built a responsive html mockup according to her design.

The client BridgeRoots is a law firm located in Japan. Their current website was built several years ago with WordPress and maintained by a vendor. The client would like to recreate the website in a modern style, update some old content, and ideally have the site load faster. We analyzed their needs and suggested making it a Jekyll based static one page website because
- the site only serves as a simple showcase of the company's profile
- the majority of site content doesn't need to be updated very often
- there isn't a lot of server-side interaction needed
- it's easier to customize a non-WordPress website
- Jekyll is blog aware so it's still not hard to update and post news (which is a secondary focus of the website's content)
