Catfw is a design framework I'm currently building.


<!--more-->
I love Bootstrap. It is awesome to use, when I want to quickly build a page or just grab a handy grid system, buttons, slider, etc. It is even more awesome when you look at how the source code is organized. Recently I started writing my own design framework "in Bootstrap's way". I also love Font Awesome and Google Material icons, but there are times that I can't find the ideal glyphs to use. I happened to be a pretty good icon designer and icon font maker, so I can just include my own "icon font service" into this framework. I can add and update easily whenever I want.

I'm constantly updating the documentation here:
