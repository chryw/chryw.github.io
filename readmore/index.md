## Intro

I'm actually a designer who can code. So I won't claim myself a full-fledged Front End Engineer just yet. I make a living at Microsoft developer's division supporting UX imagery tools and assets. My current job is more related to UX than coding, but it did help me discover my passion about front end. Through 4 years of working with talented people (designers especially) and designing for developer tools, I learn about new and exciting concepts everyday because I need to design for these technologies. It's a 40 hour full time job, but I'm not satisfied with being an "art production coordinator" or "prototyper" who just produces what's asked. I like to make or improve tools to speed up my job (and others' jobs). I found JavaScript and many front end tools are very suitable for my need. So here I walked into this field.

Then I got amazed by how fast-paced this industry is evolving, from my previous impression of "dreamweaver", "photoshop slice and export", "wordpress", to "javascript to rule the world", "continuous integration", and "framework fatigue". This industry is cool and I want to be one of the cool kids. I take online courses, build some tools for work and help friends make portfolios, basically I just look for chances to code since I'm not on a 100% dev job. I didn't really follow a linear learning path and do often

I've been working in a UX team. My role focuses on the production and management of UX related imagery such as icons, illustrations, diagrams, etc. I lead a small image production team to support almost any product areas that need image assets. We translate business needs and technical requirements into tangible visual designs. I help implement image assets and troubleshoot image related technical issues such as render performance, HDPI support, theming, and accessibility. I build catalogs and guidelines to ensure reusability and consistency. I write tools to accelerate production and optimize assets.


### Make it work

I always keep in mind that users (even it's just me myself) come to my website/app/tool to get their jobs done. Sometimes I don't have a good scaffolding template/flow for a newly emerged need. I still want to achieve the goal first though (e.g.: batch convert some images, refactor some svg code, etc.). I do try my best (within time constrains) to avoid redundancy and "temporary hacks" that would lead to long-term mess. Fortunately I work in an Agile environment where I can progressively deliver the experience and improve my flow. I always try to find the balance between making a perfect first iteration and being able to pick some low-hanging fruits quickly.

### Make it pretty

When I say "pretty" I don't mean aesthetically eye-pleasing (though my OCD sometimes calls). For work we already have style guides and a team of awesome UX designers and artists to make things look professional. I do give my It's sometimes more important to have clean code manner, scalable project structure, and good workflow before I can make the end user experience pretty (in long term, not just one time). Once things are working (or at least seems working), and I get a little more time, I start thinking how I can make the source code better. Even if it's just a small solo project that no one else would look like my code, I still want to DRY it so that when I look back, I know what I did and I can pick up and scale it up. (Of course, as a newbie dev this is just something I try to remind myself about and I admit I have a lot of ugly projects that I have yet to clean up).

### Make it fast

Although I'm probably not very qualified to talk about speed and performance at my current skill level, but this is something eventually I will need to think about. Besides the application's actual render and response performance, I also think it is important for developers to maintain and scale projects fast in long term. I pay attention to

## STAR

### **S**ituation

- Do I have enough time and bandwidth to find the best solution?
- Has anyone out there encountered similar problem before?
- What are tools out there that can help me solve the problem?
  - Which tools have better quality? (download count, open issues, last commit date)
  - Is the API well documented? (aka. can I learn how to use it quickly?)

### **T**ask

- Can the deliverable be simplified/narrowed down, or be delivered progressively?
- Am I making a one-time use thing or do I need to consider long-term sustainability?

### **A**ction

### *R*esult
