I'm creating a new website for a law firm in Japan. My friend [@irzzz](http://github.com/irzzz) is the designer and I'm the developer.

Our client Bridgeroot is a lawfirm located in Japan. Their current website was built several years ago with WordPress and maintained by a vendor. The client would like to recreate the website in a modern style, update some old content, and ideally have the site load faster. We analyzed their needs and suggested making it a Jekyll based static one page website because
- the site only serves as a simple showcase of the company's profile
- the majority of site content doesn't need to be updated very often
- there isn't a lot of server-side interaction needed
- it's easier to customize a non-WordPress website
- Jekyll is blog aware so it's still not hard to update and post news (which is a secondary focus of the website's content)

My friend  [@irzzz](http://github.com/irzzz) (UX Designer) gave me a high-fidelity wireframe for the landing page in desktop view. I'm currently working on a responsive html mockup according to her design.
