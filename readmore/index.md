## Intro

I've been working in a UX team. My role focuses on the production and management of UX related imagery such as icons, illustrations, diagrams, etc. I lead a small image production team to support almost any product areas that need image assets. We translate business needs and technical requirements into tangible visual designs. Besides leading the production work, I help implement image assets and troubleshoot image related technical issues such as render performance, HDPI support, theming, and accessibility. I build catalogs and guidelines to ensure reusability and consistency. I write tools to accelerate production and optimize assets.

I'm passionate about front end development. I won't claim myself a full-fledged Front End Engineer just yet but this is definitely a career I'm heading into. My good sense of design and my experience working with developer tools are my advantages. I'm still learning and improving while I keep my eyes open to full time front end developer opportunities, so that I can officially start this career.


## Problem solving

### Evaluate the circumstance

- Do I have enough time and bandwidth to find the best solution?
- Is this a new problem or an old one that someone already had a few attempts?
- Can the deliverable be simplified, or be delivered progressively?

### Search

- Has anyone out there encountered similar problem before?
- What are tools out there that can help me solve the problem?
- A lot of times I can just find some node packages that can do the job. If there are multiple options, then I do a quick evaluation:
  - Which one has better quality? (download count, open issues, last commit date)
  - Is the API well documented? (aka. can I learn how to use it quickly?)
- Even if I have to write my own tool, usually there are still some small parts that I can borrow from elsewhere.

### Make it work

Often times I have too little time to plan thoroughly and create the most optimized solution. Fortunately I work in an Agile environment where we can progressively deliver and improve the experience. I always try to find the balance between making a perfect first iteration and being able to fix low-hanging fruit quickly.

### Make it pretty

Here "pretty" doesn't only mean visual or UX improvement. It's sometimes more important to have clean code manner, scalable project structure, and good workflow before I can make the end user experience pretty (in long term, not just one time). Once things are working (or at least seems working), and I get a little more time, I start thinking how I can make the source code better. Even if it's just a small solo project that no one else would look like my code, I still want to DRY it so that when I look back, I know what I did and I can pick up and scale it up. (Of course, as a newbie dev this is just something I try to remind myself about and I admit I have a lot of ugly projects that I have yet to clean up).

### Make it fast

The next step is to make it perform fast, produce it fast next time.
